            <h1>Computer Science Student</h1>
            <h2>A brief insight into the life of a computer science major at OsloMet</h2>
            <p class="articleText">Have you ever wondered what life is like as student studying computer sciences? 
                Well for one, we sites like one you are visiting now. An important feature of web-pages 
                is that they have to be accessible for different users, which among other things 
                includes being scaleble for different screen-sizes. But we do not only learn about web-design, 
                all first-year students have to complete technology and society, a course which, as the name suggests, 
                is about the connection between technology and society.
            </p>
            <p class="articleText">Now that you know some of the syllabus for 
                first-year students, you might wonder where they spend their time whilst studying for the classes. 
                The area dedicated to IT students on the fourth floor of Ellen Gledischs hus is an ideal gathering place for group
                assigments or individual work. </p>
