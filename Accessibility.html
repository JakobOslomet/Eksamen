            <h1>Accessibility</h1>
            <h2>A brief presentation of the site's accessibility</h2>
            <p class="articleText">
                Accessibility is truly important for a website to establish a user-friendly 
                and inclusive design and online environment. 
                To ensure that our website is accessible we have made coding choices that 
                focus on universal design with multiple key elements, as well as running an 
                automated accessibility test. Here is a short presentation of our coding 
                decisions and the results of the automated tests. 
            </p>
            <p class="articleText">A focus point when developing our code was 
                using semantic elements in the HTML, such as heading, nav and article, 
                that convey the meaning of the content and make it more accessible. 
                We also created a responsive design so that the website would be able to 
                respond to different devices and make size adjustments depending on what 
                device the user operates on. Another key element implemented on the 
                website is contrast and color choices that make the content more visible 
                and help users with visual impairment read the content. Also, 
                the content is clear and concise with plain language to make it easier 
                to read and navigate. During the development of the website, we 
                checked the code regularly to make sure everything worked, as well as 
                making sure the site corresponded with the elements above. 
                To get an overview of the site’s accessibility we also ran multiple 
                automated tests to receive valuable information about the website. 
                This test was done by using lighthouse, an automated tool that checks performance, 
                accessibility, progressive web apps, and more. Lighthouse assesses loading time and
                how fast the page becomes interactive, how different elements work together in terms 
                of contras ratios and whether the site uses the best practice for development. 
                This feedback was essential to create a website that is accessible and focused 
                on universal design, making the best possible experience for the user. 
                When the test was completed we received an overview of the result in a number scale and gained  
                access to comments and suggestions on how to improve.

                            Examples of semantic elements that make the site more accessible. As seen in the picture above 
                            we have used header to define the content at the beggining of a section and nav to define a
                            section that contains navigation links.
