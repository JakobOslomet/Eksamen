            <p class="articleText">
                Digital competence is a key factor in ensuring the employability of candidates in 
                all professions vital to our society. This course will provide a fundamental understanding 
                of our digital world. It gives an overview of how technology affects our lives and the way 
                we work, as well as our social structures, work patterns and individual preferences 
                contributing to shaping technology. Social media, digital governance, and eHealth are all
                examples of how technology has profoundly changed our everyday lives in the last few 
                ecades. An understanding of the benefits and limitations of technology is vital in any
                profession, regardless of field or speciality. In this course, students will acquire 
                the basic knowledge required to harness the potential of technology and recognise its
                limitations and potentially harmful consequences on work and society. They will learn 
                to identify the opportunities to use technology to foster inclusion and participation 
                in an increasingly diverse and multicultural society. They will practice communicating 
                orally the concepts they acquire in a structured manner. If you want more information
